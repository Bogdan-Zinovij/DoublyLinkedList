## What is DoublyLinkedList?

Doubly Linked List - this is the class used to create double-linked lists. The class creates an empty list, which is gradually filled with elements that can be accessed by traversing the list from head to tail or from tail to head. The class consists of three encapsulated fields: the head of the list, the tail of the list and its length.

The class also has many methods for working with a list:

- **append(element: Character)**
  Adds an item to the end of the list

---

- **length()**
  Returns the length of the list

---

- **insert(element: Character, index: Integer)**
  Inserts an item at a specified position

---

- **delete(index: Integer)**
  Removes the item at the specified position

---

- **deleteAll(element: Character)**
  Removes all items on the specified item

---

- **get(index: Integer)**
  Returns the character of an element at a given index

---

- **clone()**
  returns a new list that is a copy of the previous one

---

- **reverse()**
  Reverses the position of items in the list

---

- **findFirst(index: Integer)**
  Finds the first item in the list with the specified character

---

- **findLast(index: Integer)**
  Finds the last item in the list with the specified character

---

- **extend(elements: List)**
  Extends the list of items from the second list

---

- **clear()**
  Removes all items from the list

---

## Variant number calculation:

`7 % 2 = 1`
1 - doubly linked list
